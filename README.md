# Creating a Persistent Monitoring Script

## Objective

We aim to develop a Python script that simulates user monitoring with enhanced persistence capabilities. This script will include keystroke logging, screenshot functionality, system monitoring, and directory verification. Additionally, it will encrypt all captured data before transmitting it to a server for secure storage and analysis.

## Part 1: Advanced Capture and Monitoring

### Task 1: Key Capture and Screenshots

- **Implement a Keylogger**: Develop a Python-based keylogger to capture all user keystrokes and save them into a log file. This keylogger will operate stealthily in the background and initialize automatically at system startup.

- **Capture Screenshots**: Set up a mechanism to periodically capture and save screenshots of the user's screen to a specified directory.

### Task 2: System Activity Monitoring

- **Collect System Information**: Write a function to gather critical system information, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and a list of currently running processes.

### Task 3: Script Persistence

- **Ensure Script Continuity**: Design the script to ensure it remains active and continues executing even after a system reboot.

### Task 4: Directory Check and ZIP Creation

- **Routine Check**: Implement a routine that checks the contents of the `TARGETDIR` directory daily, compresses its contents into a ZIP file, and prepares it for server transmission.

## Part 2: Encryption and Data Transmission

### Task 5: Data Encryption

- **Encrypt Captured Data**: Ensure that all captured data, including keystrokes, screenshots, and ZIP files, are encrypted before they are sent to the server.

### Task 6: Sending Encrypted Data

- **Configure Data Transmission**: Configure the script to transmit the encrypted data to a server securely.

## Part 3: Decoding and Notification Server

### Task 7: Python Server

- **Server Development**: Develop a server-side script that receives, decrypts, and processes the encrypted data sent from the monitoring script.

### Task 8: Integration with Telegram

- **Telegram Bot Notifications**: Create a Telegram bot to receive and display notifications and alerts from the server about the captured data and other significant events.
